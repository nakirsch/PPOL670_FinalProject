### PPOL 670 | Final Project

This assignment is stored on the following [Github repository](https://github.com/nakirsch/PPOL670_FinalProject). 

This project uses data from Open Data DC on crime incidents in DC from 2010 to 
2022, as well as demographic data from the Census's 5-year surveys, to study 
how DC's crime rates and types of crime have changed over the course of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and over the ten years leading up to the pandemic. In this 
analysis, we first explore DC's crime counts and rates through data 
visualization, then use lasso regression to predict the number of crimes in DC
in a given year. 

Our data visualizations and predictive modeling can provide policymakers a
better understanding of the types, frequency, and patterns of crimes reported 
in DC. More importantly, it provides an in-depth look at what factors contribute
to crime in DC both pre and post pandemic, informing policymakers on potential
ways to address crimes in DC.

### Creating Datasets on Crime Incidents
The geojson files come from Open Data DC, the District of Columbia's open source
database. From this database, we gathered DC crime data from 2010 to 2022 which
includes crimes reported in different areas of DC with information such as
report date, type of offense, location of crime incident, and time of event. 
From this data, we created two datasets: crime_data_total, which includes DC crime
incidents reported from 2019 to 2022, and crime_data_2010s, which includes DC crime
incidents reported from 2010 to 2019.

```{r}
#Load in data
crime_data22 <- st_read("data/Crime_Incidents_in_2022.geojson") %>%
  clean_names()

```

### Converting Data and Creating Counts of the Number of Crimes
In order to analyze this data, we converted our datasets into four different
datasets:

crime_data_total_2: We separated and converted the crime incident report date
into a 'Date' classification using our "crime_data_total" dataset.  

crime_data_2010s_2: We separated and converted the crime incident report date
into a 'Date' classification using our "crime_data_2010s" dataset. 

crime_count: We filtered, grouped, and summarized our "crime_data_total_2" 
dataset to create a dataset with the number of crimes reported in January,
February, and March in the years 2019 to 2022.

crime_graph_data: We grouped and summarized our "crime_data_total_2" to create
a dataset counting the number of crimes reported by date from 2019 to 2022.


```{r}
crime_data_total_2 <- crime_data_total %>%
  separate(
    col = report_dat,
    into = c("date", "time"),
    sep = " ",
    remove = FALSE
  ) %>%
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date),
         ymd = paste(year, month, day, sep = "-"),
         date2 = as.Date(ymd)) 

crime_count <- crime_data_total_2 %>%
  filter(month < 4,
         !is.na(ward))%>%
  group_by(ward, year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() 

crime_graph_data <- crime_data_total_2 %>%
  group_by(date2) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() 

crime_data_2010s_2 <- crime_data_2010s %>%
  separate(
    col = report_dat,
    into = c("date", "time"),
    sep = " ",
    remove = FALSE
  ) %>%
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date)) 

crime_count_2010s <- crime_data_2010s_2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(ward))%>%
  group_by(ward, year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

### Exploratory Analysis of Crime in DC Between 2019 and 2022

The bar chart below visualizes number of crimes reported in each ward by type of 
offense in Washington, DC from 2019 to 2022. We also provide a map of DC's 8 wards
below for reference.

![DC.gov: Wards of the District of Columbia](dc_wards.png)

Based on the visualization below, arson, homicide, and sex abuse are the least 
commonly reported crimes, while theft is the most common. The ward with the highest
overall crime counts is Ward 2, where Georgetown University is located.  

```{r}
#Type of Crime Committed by Crime Count
crime_data_total_2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(ward)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(offense, fill = ward)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Crimes by Type of Offense in Washington, DC (2019 - 2022)",
    subtitle = "By Ward",
    x = "Type of Criminal Offense",
    y = "Crime Count",
    fill = "Ward",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022."
  ) + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))
```

The bar chart below visualizes number of crimes reported in all of DC from 
2019 to 2022 based on the shift time (Day, Evening, Midnight) the crime was 
reported. Based on the visualization, the evening shift has the most reported crimes
and the midnight shift has the least. 

```{r}
# Shift Crime Report by Crime Count 
crime_data_total_2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(ward)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(shift)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Crimes by Shift in Washington, DC (2019 - 2022)",
    x = "Shift Crime Reported",
    y = "Crime Count",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022."
  )
```

The 4 bar charts below reflect the number of crimes in Washington, DC by ward 
for the months January to March in the years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Overall, 
crimes vastly decreased during the pandemic years (2021-2022) compared to pre-pandemic 
ones (2019-2020).

```{r}
#Number of crimes in January Through March
crime_count %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ward, y = count, fill = ward, ymax = 2000)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = count, vjust = -0.25)) +
  labs (
    title = "Number of Crimes in in Washington, DC \(January through March of 2019 to 2022)",
    subtitle = "By Ward",
    x = "Ward",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022."
  ) + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Ward") +
  theme(panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines"),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 13))

```

The scatter plots below visualize crime counts in all of DC during the Holiday 
season (November to January) from 2019 to 2022. In both scatter plots, 
Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day have low crime counts than other days. 
However, the days surrounding these holidays differ in crime count between 2020-2021 and 
2021-2022 with some crime significantly increasing after one of the holidays.

```{r}
#Crime Count during the Holidays (2020 - 2021) 
crime_graph_data %>%
  filter("2020-11-14" < date2) %>%
  filter( date2 < "2021-01-16") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date2, count, label = date2, color = count < 53 & date2 < "2021-01-02")) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Crimers (per day) ",
    title = "Crime Count during the Holidays in Washington, DC (Nov 2020 - Jan 2021)",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022."
  ) +
 scale_x_date(breaks = "5 days",
             date_labels = "%b %d %Y") + 
  theme(legend.position="none",axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1)) 


#Crime Count during the Holidays (2021 - 2022)
crime_graph_data %>%
  filter("2021-11-15" < date2) %>%
  filter( date2 < "2022-01-16") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date2, count, label = date2, color = count < 53 & date2 < "2022-01-02")) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Crimers (per day) ",
    title = "Crime Count during the Holidays in Washington, DC (Nov 2021 - Jan 2022)",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022."
  ) + 
 scale_x_date(breaks = "5 days",
             date_labels = "%b %d %Y") + 
    theme(legend.position="none",axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1)) 
```

### Exploratory Analysis of Crime in DC Between 2010 and 2019

The animated bar graph explores the number of crimes reported by ward from the 
years 2010 to 2019. Over the past decade, crime rates varied year by year. In 2016,
mostly all of DC's wards significantly increased in crimes reported compared to 
the other years. Additionally, Ward 2 was consistently the highest in crimes reported 
from 2010 to 2019. 

```{r}
#Animated plot for change in crime over time
crime_over_time <- crime_count_2010s %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ward, y = count, fill = ward)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs (
    title = "Number of Crimes in Washington, DC in {frame_time}",
    subtitle = "By Ward",
    x = "Ward",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2010 to 2019.",
  ) + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Ward") +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  ease_aes('linear')

#animate graph
animate(crime_over_time, nframes = 10, duration = 10, fps = 1, width = 400, height = 400, renderer = gifski_renderer())
#anim_save("crime_over_time_gif.gif")
```

To further explore crimes reported in DC from 2010 to 2019, we conducted 
geospatial analysis using Open Data DC crime data, DC Census Tracts Data, and
DC Police Station data. 

```{r}
# Read in DC census tracts data
dctracts <- st_read("data/Census_Tracts_in_2010.geojson") %>%
  st_set_crs(value = 4326) %>%
  clean_names()

#Read in Police stations data
policestations <- st_read("data/Police_Stations.geojson") %>%
  st_set_crs(value = 4326) %>%
  clean_names()

# Wrangling to create crime rate, crime count, etc.
crime_merged <- st_join(dctracts, crime_data_total_2, join = st_contains, left = TRUE)

crime_merged_agg <- crime_merged %>%
  group_by(tract, year) %>%
  summarize(count = n(),
            population = mean(p0030001),
            year = mean(year)) %>%
  mutate(crimerate = count/population*1000)

# Visualizations
pop_map <- ggplot() +
   geom_sf(
    data = dctracts,
    aes(fill = p0010001)
) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue",
                      high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Tract Population in 2019",
       fill = "Population",
       caption = "Open Data DC. Updated 2021. Census Tracts in 2010.") +
  theme_void()

crimerate_map <- ggplot() +
   geom_sf(
    data = crime_merged_agg %>% filter(tract != "006202"),
    aes(fill = crimerate),
    color = "white"
) +
  scale_fill_gradient2() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  labs(title = "Crime Rate in Census Tracts by Year",
       fill = "Crime Rate",
       caption = "Open Data DC. Updated 2021. Census Tracts in 2010. \
       Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022.") +
  theme_void()

crime_police21 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = dctracts,
    fill = "white"
) +
  geom_sf(
    data = crime_data_total_2 %>% filter(year == 2021),
    color = "light pink",
    alpha = 0.05
) +
  geom_sf(
    data = policestations,
    color = "blue"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Crimes Reported and Police Stations in DC in 2021",
    caption = "Open Data DC. Updated 2021. Census Tracts in 2010. \
    Open Data DC. Crime Incidents in years 2019 to 2022 \
    Open Data DC. Updated 2021. Police Stations."
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

Using DC Census Tract Data and Open Data DC data, the map below illustrates
the population by census tract in all of DC in 2019. 

```{r}
pop_map
```

The maps illustrated below reflect the crime rate by tract in the years 2019 to 
2022. According to the maps, the crime rate decreased in 2021 and 2022 compared
to 2019 and 2022. 

```{r}
crimerate_map
```

The map below visualizes crimes reported in DC in 2021 (light pink) and the 
location of police stations (blue). We can see that there are more police 
stations in high-crime reported areas. 

```{r}
crime_police21
```

Based the data visualizations above, crime decreased overall during the 
pandemic, which is most likely due to the pandemic shutdowns that took place in 
2020 and the slow reopening/use of of shops, restaurants, workplaces, and 
transit in 2021 and 2022.
